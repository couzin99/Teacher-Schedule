# Teacher Schedule Manager

A simple web application for managing teacher schedules with automatic conflict detection.

## Features

✅ **Add New Schedules** - Create schedules for teachers with subject, day, time, and room information.

✅ **Conflict Detection** - Automatically detects:
- **Teacher Conflicts**: Prevents the same teacher from being scheduled at two different places at the same time
- **Room Conflicts**: Prevents the same room from being double-booked at the same time

✅ **Real-time Notifications** - Get error messages when trying to add conflicting schedules

✅ **Multiple Views**:
- **Teacher View**: See all schedules grouped by teacher with conflict warnings
- **All Schedules View**: See all schedules in a sortable list

✅ **Conflict Highlighting** - Conflicting schedules are highlighted in red for easy identification

✅ **Data Persistence** - All schedules are saved in your browser's local storage

✅ **Easy Management** - Delete schedules with a single click

## How to Use

### 1. **Open the Application**
   - Simply open `index.html` in any web browser

### 2. **Add a Schedule**
   - Fill in the form on the left side:
     - **Teacher Name**: Enter the teacher's full name (e.g., "Juan Dela Cruz")
     - **Subject**: Enter the subject being taught (e.g., "Mathematics")
     - **Day**: Select the day of the week (Monday - Saturday)
     - **Start Time**: Select when the class starts (7:00 AM - 7:00 PM)
     - **End Time**: Select when the class ends (must be after start time)
     - **Room**: Enter the room number or name (e.g., "Room 101")
   - Click **"Add Schedule"** to add the schedule

### 3. **Conflict Detection**
   - If there's a conflict (same teacher scheduled twice or same room booked twice in overlapping times), you'll see an error message
   - The system **won't allow you to add the schedule** until the conflict is resolved
   - Example error messages:
     ```
     ⚠️ Conflict detected!
     
     Teacher conflict: Juan Dela Cruz is already scheduled for 
     Mathematics in Room 101 from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM.
     ```

### 4. **View Schedules**
   
   **By Teacher (Default View)**:
   - Click the **"By Teacher"** tab
   - See all teachers listed with their schedules
   - Teachers with conflicts show a **⚠️ CONFLICT** badge
   - A red warning message appears: "This teacher has X scheduling conflict(s). Please fix before confirming."
   - Conflicting schedule rows are highlighted in red

   **All Schedules View**:
   - Click the **"All Schedules"** tab
   - See all schedules in chronological order (sorted by day and time)
   - Conflicting schedules are highlighted in red
   - Shows which schedules have conflicts at a glance

### 5. **Delete a Schedule**
   - Click the **"Delete"** button next to any schedule
   - Confirm the deletion when prompted
   - The schedule will be removed and other schedules will update automatically

## Time Range

- **Operating Hours**: 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM
- **Days**: Monday through Saturday (Sunday is not included)
- The system enforces that all classes must fall within this time window

## Example Workflow

1. Add Teacher A for Math on Monday 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM in Room 101
   ✓ Success

2. Try to add Teacher A for Science on Monday 8:30 AM - 9:30 AM in Room 102
   ✗ Error: Teacher conflict detected!

3. Delete the first schedule and try again
   ✓ Success

4. Now add another teacher for Math on Monday 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM in Room 101
   ✗ Error: Room conflict detected!

## Data Storage

All schedules are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This means:
- Your schedules persist even if you close and reopen the browser
- Data is stored locally on your computer
- Clearing browser history/cache may delete your schedules

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Notes

- Teacher names and room names are case-insensitive (e.g., "juan dela cruz" = "Juan Dela Cruz")
- The system checks for overlapping times, not just exact matches
- You can have the same subject taught by different teachers or in different rooms without conflicts

## Logo / Background Image

- To use the attached institution image as the subtle page background, place the image file in the project at `assets/logo.png` (create the `assets` folder if missing). The CSS already references `assets/logo.png`.

## Deployment (share a link)

You can host this as a static website and share a link with your colleague. Two easy free options:

1) GitHub Pages
   - Create a GitHub repository and push the project files.
   - In the repository settings enable **Pages** and select the `main` (or `master`) branch and folder (`/root`). GitHub will publish the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>`.

2) Netlify (recommended for simple drag-and-drop)
   - Create a free Netlify account.
   - Drag-and-drop the project folder (or connect your GitHub repo) into Netlify — it will give you a shareable URL.

Both options host static HTML/CSS/JS sites (no server required). Your colleague will open the shared link in their browser and use the app.

## Local sharing (alternative)

- If you prefer not to host, you can zip the project and send it to your colleague. They can open `index.html` in a browser directly.
- Or run a simple local server (recommended to avoid some browser restrictions):

```bash
# (Python 3) from the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in the browser
```

## Next steps (I can help)

- I can add a small export/import button so your colleague can import schedules easily.
- Or I can set this up on GitHub Pages or Netlify for you and give you the live link — tell me which you prefer and I will walk you through required credentials.
